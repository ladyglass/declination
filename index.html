    <h1>Man declines prison release</h1>
    <p class="flourish">~</p>
    <p class="bio">Arnaud Lefevre was released from prison this weekend after nearly a decade behind bars. His sudden freedom came as a surprise, as Lefevre had served less than half of his sentence for aggravated manslaughter. He still feels a deep remorse for his crime, despite the fact that authorities are now saying it never happened.</p>

      <p> “I don’t understand,” he told waiting reporters outside of Fleury-Mérogis Prison upon his release. “I am a murderer! I killed my son!”</p>
      <p>“I beg to differ,” Samuel Lefevre, Arnaud’s alleged victim, told us by phone. “I’m very much still alive.”</p>
      <p>Although no body was ever found, Arnaud was convicted based on his own detailed confession, as well as blood splatter evidence in the home the two shared in Barfleur, Manche. Arnaud, a hunter with a category C gun license, claimed to have shot his son shortly after learning Samuel was gay. His account of the crime is chilling.</p>
      <p>“I felt like my mind was in a fog in the hours after he told me. When I loaded my gun, I could not think of Samuel as my son, but as something that had taken over and destroyed my son,” the transcript reads. “He did not turn to look at me as I entered his room. I thought, if he were still my son, he would at least acknowledge me, in spite of the anger. Neither of us said anything. I simply raised the weapon at the back of his skull to ensure I hit his brain, where I suspected the infection had taken root, and I squeezed the trigger.”</p>
      <p>Lefevre then claimed to have dumped the body in the English Channel before being overcome with grief. That’s when he went to police and confessed.</p>
      <p>Authorities said evidence at the scene was consistent with his account of events. Coupled with the sudden disappearance of Samuel, a convicted was easily secured.</p>
      <p>When reached for comment, prosecutor Edwige Mercier maintained that Lefevre is still a guilty man. </p>
      <p>“We are sure, based on the facts, that Arnaud Lefevre killed somebody,” said Mercier. “I assure you, when we find out who, Lefevre will be brought back to justice.”</p>
      <p>Mercier’s case and Lefevre’s conviction were called into question last month. While writing an article on crimes against the gay community, a reporter researching Lefevre’s story discovered a shocking fact: Samuel Lefevre was alive and well, living in Avignon. After authorities confirmed he was indeed the son of Arnaud Lefevre, they began the process to overturn the conviction.</p>
      <p>Lefevre was uncooperative during the process, maintaining that he was a killer and belonged behind bars.</p>
      <p>When asked whether he’d like to speak or reconcile with his father, Samuel replied, “No. He may not have murdered me, but I know that he would have. He killed me in his heart, and that is enough. I no longer have any place in mine for the man.”</p>
